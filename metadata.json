    "Title": "MolBloom: molecule purchasability in ZINC20",
    "Description": "This model uses a Bloom filter to query the ZINC20 database to identify if a molecule is purchasable. A bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure to identify whether an element is in a given set. Due to the nature of bloom filters, false negatives are not possible (i.e if the model returns False, the molecule is not purchasable). As stated by the author, if the model returns True the molecule is purchasable with an error rate of 0.0003 (according to the ZINC20 catalog).",
